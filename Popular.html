The Taj Mahal is a white marble built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife, Mumtaz Mahal. In Arabic, the Taj Mahal is known as "crown of palaces".
The Taj Mahal was built by a whopping 22,000 laborers, painters, stonecutters, embroidery artists. Legend has it that Emperor Shah Jahan intended to build another Taj Mahal in black marble across the river but a war with his sons interrupted these plans.</td></tr>

Jaisalmer is named after Maharaj Rawal Jaisal. Later, he built the Jaisalmer Fort on the Trikuta Hill which has now become one of the most popular heritage sites. The fort walls guarded the entire city until Ala-ud-Din Khilji attacked and captured it in the 13th century and managed to hold it for nine years. Jaisalmer played a major role as the gateway to Persian countries, encouraging a flourishing trade during medieval times.
The Thar Desert in Jaisalmer plays a significant role in tourism, attracting tourists from all around the world.</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color:white;color:black;"><td style="border:5px solid black;">Kerala<img src="Kerala.jpg" width="150px" height="100px"</td><td style="border:2px solidblack;">.With a network of 44 rivers and turquoise blue backwaters, Kerala basks in the lap of nature. This pristine and serene state lies in the South - Eastern part of India and is much favoured due to its exotic wildlife, herbs, emerald green hill stations and the crystal clear Arabian Sea along its coast. It is indeed God's own country.
According to a survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), Kerala is said to be the cleanest state of India along with Sikkim. The only state to have hospitals and banks in every village. Along with being the cleanest state it also offers necessary facilities in every corner. Kerala is the only state to have provided banking facilities and hospitals in its remotest locations, thus increasing its overall development.</td></tr>

Now, this is the Pink City area of Jaipur (Old Jaipur) I am talking about. So anyone who wants to enter or exit from Jaipur city has to pass through these gates.And inside the city, the construction was planned in a unique way of a 3×3 grid system which made it very easy for locals to travel across Jaipur, as all the small lanes of Jaipur would end up on the main road. 
The color Pink is so closely associated with Jaipur that the moment you think of Pink color, Jaipur immediately comes to your mind. </td></tr>
